- product model: name, price, sizes, inventory count
- modularize groups of components, services, directives, etc.
- product name: can't exceed a certain number of characters (use pipe?)
- product click should redirect to details
- add address to store (contact info page)
- banner
- start automating tests ASAP
- checkout page?
- refactor how filtering is done to get an items component based on category or query string
- refactor dropdown menu to not use stubs
